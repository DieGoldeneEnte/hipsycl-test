**I have a working version of hipSYCL+tests (not yet public) so there is no reason to use this** if you want it before I get around to cleanup/test just ping me :)

This is just a little project to get an environment with
[hipSYCL](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL) to work.

**It currently only works for CPU** and might not the best approach to this.

To get hipSYCL working I use my fork of the nixos-rocm repository containing the
derivation for hipSYCL (also WIP) in the hipsycl banch.
